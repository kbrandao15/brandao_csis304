          Washington, named after the first US President George Washington, became the 42nd State 
          in the Union in 1889.  "The Evergreen State" is the 13th most populous state.  Most of 
          this population lives in the Seattle metropolitan area.

          Washington's ecosystem is diverse and beautiful.  We have a temperate rainforest, desert, 
          prairies, sand dunes, alpine and subalpine meadows, plateaus, freshwater wetlands, 
          and mountains to name a few.  Mount Rainier National Park, North Cascades National Park, 
          and Olympic National Park are some of the fifteen National Park Services in Washington State.

          Washington has three major professional sports teams: the Seattle Mariners (baseball), 
          the Seattle Seahawks (football), and the Seattle Sounders (soccer).  The 2008 relocation 
          of the Seattle SuperSonics (the Sonics) basketball team to Oklahoma is still a sore spot 
          for many fans.

          Some famous Washingtonians include actor Chris Pratt, actor and singer Bing Crosby, 
          guitarist Jimi Hendrix, and actress Anna Ferris (she dated one of my high school teachers).  
          The small city of Forks was put on the map for being the setting of the Twilight series.  
          The houseboats of Seattle were made famous in the 1993 movie Sleepless in Seattle, 
          starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.

          Aerospace, agriculture and food manufacturing, clean technology, information and communication
          technology, forest products, life science and global health, maritime, and military and 
          defense sectors are Washington's major industries.  Amazon, Starbucks, Nordstrom, Weyerhaeuser, 
          Expeditors International, Alaska Airlines, Costco Wholesale, Microsoft (just a 7 minute drive 
          from my house), Expedia, and Eddie Bauer are some companies with Washington State headquarters.

          Washington is also known for its World War II production.  7,500 workers in Boeing plants in 
          Seattle and Renton, Washington started the production of over 8,200 planes.  B-17s and B-29s 
          were two of the major bombers produced.  The Grand Coulee Dam, the largest concrete structure 
          in the United States, was built to help power production.  The now decommissioned Hanford Works 
          atomic energy plant housed the first full-scale plutonium production reactor.
