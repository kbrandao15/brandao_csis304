                 Hello, my name is Katie Brandao.  
                 I love God, my family and friends, most all things Disney, 
                 good books, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, yummy food, Narnia, 
                 good music, and playing card/board games.  When I was little some 
                 of my aspirations were to be an astronaut, a Disney Princess, 
                 and a pilot, and now I'm studying History with a Computer Science 
                 and Cinematic Arts minor at George Fox University, with many more
                 aspirations I could list.  My dad, mom, and two younger sisters live 
                 in Redmond, WA with our dog and three parakeets.
